/* Wouter: I think this confusion between 1 and 8 is caused by differences in USB 1 vs 2.  Earlier versions of the specification divide bus time into 1-millisecond frames, each of which can carry multiple transactions to multiple destinations. (A transaction contains two or more packets: a token packet and one or more data packets, a handshake packet, or both.) The USB 2.0 specification divides the 1-millisecond frame into eight, 125-microsecond microframes, each of which can carry multiple transactions to multiple destinations.
 
 This driver seems hard coded to do 1000 requests per second (see CalculateSamplesPerFrame.). What puzzles me is that this is the maximum.
 
 Note on the docu that I added: A number of functions here are obligatory implementations of the IOAudioEngine. Others are support functions for our convenience. It is unfortunate that the distinction is unclear and also that I have to document functions that should (and probably do) already have documentation in the interface definition.  Maybe I'm missing something?

/*! Number of frames that we transfer in a request to USB. USB transfers frames once per millisecond
 But we prepare NUMBER_FRAMES so that we do not have to deal with that every ms but only every NUMBER_FRAMES ms.
 These frames are grouped into a single request, the larger this number the larger the chunks we get from USB.
 
 Technically this size should be irrelevant, because the array is refreshed in memory anyway and because the
 timestamps we need are stored in the USB frames as long as we need them.
 
 However, it seems that the exact time at which we call takeTimeStamp is critical as well.
 
 THIS NUMBER MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 8, see EMUUSBInputStream frameNumberIncreasePerRead.

     (2) to free up the framelist so that we can redeploy it to continue reading
     (3) so that we can do int-to-float conversion 'offline'.
     However it seems that these are no strong reasons, probably we could just simulate a ring buffer
     and redeploy the frameList only after conversion for the HAL.
